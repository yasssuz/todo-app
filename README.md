- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SCSS
- PostCss (for configuration only)
- Tailwind.css
- Vite bundler
- Mobile first workflow

### What I learned

Very simple todo application. I tried for the first time the a new javascript API called "MutationObserver" and it's awesome. I will clearly use it in a few project i have in mind because you can have a ton of control an observe every change in the dom easily.
